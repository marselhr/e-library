## Intro

Hello, I developed this project as one of the tasks in the Batch 6 Certified Internship selection series at the Detikom partnership. I applied for the position of Backend Developer of CTARSA Foundation, so I was given the task of creating a CMS website with a common CRUD feature. I had to create authentication features and master data management of Books and Book Categories. To save time, I decided to use the Laravel framework for this project. The required features have been successfully fulfilled and can be seen in the [Screenshoot](#item4) section
